Perfect. Here's how to wrap the refresh logic in a **stored procedure** so you can manually trigger the refresh of your materialized view anytime you want, in addition to the scheduled daily event.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Setup: Stored Procedure + Event Scheduler + Logging

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Materialized View Table (if not already created)

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employee_summary_mv (
  department_id INT,
  total_employees INT
);
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Logging Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mv_refresh_log (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  refresh_time DATETIME,
  status VARCHAR(50),
  message TEXT
);
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Stored Procedure

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE sp_refresh_employee_summary_mv()
BEGIN
  DECLARE exit HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION
  BEGIN
    -- Log the failure
    INSERT INTO mv_refresh_log (refresh_time, status, message)
    VALUES (NOW(), 'FAILED', 'Error during refresh procedure');
  END;

  -- Create temporary staging table
  CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employee_summary_mv_temp (
    department_id INT,
    total_employees INT
  );

  -- Clear previous temp data (in case it exists)
  DELETE FROM employee_summary_mv_temp;

  -- Insert fresh data into temp table
  INSERT INTO employee_summary_mv_temp
  SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY department_id;

  -- Replace contents of materialized view table
  DELETE FROM employee_summary_mv;
  INSERT INTO employee_summary_mv
  SELECT * FROM employee_summary_mv_temp;

  -- Log the success
  INSERT INTO mv_refresh_log (refresh_time, status, message)
  VALUES (NOW(), 'SUCCESS', 'Refreshed successfully');
END$$

DELIMITER ;
```

---

### ‚úÖ 4Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Scheduled Event to Call the Stored Procedure

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE EVENT IF NOT EXISTS refresh_employee_summary_mv_event
ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 DAY
STARTS TIMESTAMP(CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL 1 DAY) + INTERVAL 2 HOUR
DO
BEGIN
  CALL sp_refresh_employee_summary_mv();
END$$

DELIMITER ;
```

---

### üöÄ 5Ô∏è‚É£ Manually Run the Refresh Anytime

You can now trigger the refresh manually like this:

```sql
CALL sp_refresh_employee_summary_mv();
```

---

### üîç 6Ô∏è‚É£ Monitor Refresh Logs

View the latest refresh results:

```sql
SELECT * FROM mv_refresh_log ORDER BY refresh_time DESC LIMIT 10;
```

---

## ‚úÖ You're All Set

With this setup:

* The materialized view (`employee_summary_mv`) is refreshed daily at 2:00 AM.
* You can refresh it manually using the stored procedure.
* All refresh attempts (success or failure) are logged.
* Data is safely staged using a temporary table to avoid incomplete updates.

Would you like this packaged into a single SQL file for easier deployment?
